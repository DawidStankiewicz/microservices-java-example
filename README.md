# microservices java example

## Features demonstrated

#### âœ… Microservice in Spring Boot with REST API
- pool-service with PoolRepository created using `@RepositoryRestResource`

#### âœ… DB service
- postgres

#### âœ… Centralized & boot time loaded service configuration
- Spring Cloud configuration server with git-based backend
- **pool-service** connects to **configuration-server** on boot time and loads available configuration based on `spring.profiles.active` property (e.g. `java -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -jar target\pool-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`)

#### âœ… Version controlled configuration 
- configuration-server looks for configuration on git (at [configuration](/configuration) directory)

#### âœ… Microservices can refresh when a new configuration appears
- while using `@RefreshScope` annotation, Spring Boot Actuator adds `/refresh` endpoint to refresh the service and reread the configuration form **configuration-server**
- applied in **pool-service** and **results-service**

#### ðŸ”œ Secrets in microservice's configuration are encrypted (like password to database)

#### âœ… Auto discovery of microservices
- `pool-service` and `result-service` register themselves in discovery service

#### âœ… Feign Client with HATEOAS example
- check `PoolVotesFeignClient`
- example of reading collection from _embedded HAT+JSON using `CollectionModel`

#### âœ… Microservices resilience patterns
Check current state at `/actuator/health`.  
Patterns are configured in **results-service**.

- âœ… Retry
- âœ… Circuit Breaker
- âœ… Rate Limiter
- âœ… Bulkhead
- âœ… Fallback
- ðŸ”œ Cache

#### âœ… Deployment using Docker containers
- âœ… locally on Docker Compose - [build_and_start_compose.sh](build_and_start_compose.sh)
- âœ… locally on Kubernetes (minikube) - [build_and_start_kubernetes.sh](build_and_start_kubernetes.sh)
- ðŸ”œ on AWS services

#### ðŸ”œ Automatic service replication

#### âœ… Automatic health-check endpoint using Spring Actuator
- **pool-service** has in its `pom.xml` `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency, so **pool-service** status can be retrieved from `/actuator/health`

#### âœ… Automatic health checks
- âœ… Docker Compose health checks
- âœ… Kubernetes health checks

#### ðŸ”œ Service monitoring

#### âœ… Gateway service
- **gateway-server** as reverse proxy for all services registered in **discovery-service**

#### ðŸ”œ OAuth2

#### ðŸ”œ JWT token

#### ðŸ”œ Messaging system - Spring Cloud Stream + Kafka

#### ðŸ”œ CI/CD pipelines for each module

#### ðŸ”œ Unit tests job

#### ðŸ”œ Integration tests job

#### ðŸ”œ Coverage job

#### ðŸ”œ Build job + artifactory

#### ðŸ”œ Data caching

#### ðŸ”œ Logging aggregation

## Start solution

### Docker compose

Run the whole solution on localhost using single script:

```bash
bash build_and_start_compose.sh
```

if you have already built services' jars, then you can skip build part and just start docker compose:

```bash
bash start_compose.sh
```

### Kubernetes

If you have installed kubernetes and already have running minikube cluster, then you can start the solution using:
```bash
bash build_and_start_kubernetes.sh
```
It will compile jar file for each service, build docker image available for the minikube cluster and deploy services on the cluster.

Then you can use this script to just start services:
```bash
bash start_kubernetes.sh
```

To stop them use:
```bash
bash stop_kubernetes.sh
```

**Gateway server** will be exposed on minikube IP (which you can check by typing `minikube ip` in your terminal), e.g.:
```ip
curl 172.21.58.62:8072/actuator/health
```

## Template
If you wish to use this repository as your next project starter, remember to extract each service to its own repository. 
Here, all services (and configuration) are in single git repository to simplify the example.
